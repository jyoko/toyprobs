# Calculator

From [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com), the [Evaluate mathematical expression](http://www.codewars.com/kata/52a78825cdfc2cfc87000005).

Essentially, a calculator that supports `+`, `*`, `/`, `(`, `)`, and `-` for both subtraction and negation.

Solution is a recursive descent, if a bit messy.
